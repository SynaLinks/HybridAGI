# Document

Documents are the atomic data used in HybridAGI's Document Memory, they are used to represent textual data and their chunks in the system. Allowing the system to implement vector-only [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) systems.

`Document`: Represent an unstructured textual data to be processed or saved into memory.

`DocumentList`: A list of documents to be processed or saved into memory.

`QueryWithDocuments`: A list of document associated with a Query used by the retrievers and rerankers.
  
## Definition

```python
class Document(BaseModel):
    id: Union[UUID, str] = Field(description="Unique identifier for the document", default_factory=uuid4)
    text: str = Field(description="The actual text content of the document")
    parent_id: Optional[Union[UUID, str]] = Field(description="Identifier for the parent document", default=None)
    vector: Optional[List[float]] = Field(description="Vector representation of the document", default=None)
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(description="Additional information about the document", default={})
    
    def to_dict(self):
        if self.metadata:
            return {"text": self.text, "metadata": self.metadata}
        else:
            return {"text": self.text}

class DocumentList(BaseModel, dspy.Prediction):
    docs: Optional[List[Document]] = Field(description="List of documents", default=[])
    
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        BaseModel.__init__(self, **kwargs)
        dspy.Prediction.__init__(self, **kwargs)
        
    def to_dict(self):
        return {"documents": [d.to_dict() for d in self.docs]}

class QueryWithDocuments(BaseModel, dspy.Prediction):
    queries: QueryList = Field(description="The input query list", default_factory=QueryList)
    docs: Optional[List[Document]] = Field(description="List of documents", default=[])
    
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        BaseModel.__init__(self, **kwargs)
        dspy.Prediction.__init__(self, **kwargs)
        
    def to_dict(self):
        return {"queries": [q.query for q in self.queries.queries], "documents": [d.to_dict() for d in self.docs]}
```

## Usage

```python
input_data = \
[
    {
        "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
        "content": "The Catcher in the Rye is a novel by J. D. Salinger, partially published in serial form in 1945â€“1946 and as a novel in 1951.

The novel is renowned for its sensitivity and depth in addressing racial injustice, class, gender roles, and destruction of innocence."
    }
]

document_list = DocumentList()

for data in input_data:
    document_list.docs.append(
        Document(
            text=data["content"],
            metadata={"title": data["title"]},
        )
    )
