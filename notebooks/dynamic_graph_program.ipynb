    "# Dynamic Graph Program\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to explore the dynamic calls of programs. This feature is particurly important for learning systems and systems with an extensive range of capabilities. If your system have a wide range of capabilities, choosing the one to use in the main program will likely to be impractical because each decision will add latency to your program. In that case, it is better to work with dynamic programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protected programs\n",
    "\n",
    "When experimenting with dynamic calls, one important feature of HybridAGI is the fact that we use the dependency graph of HybridAGI to protect the main prompting mechanism that usually contains the safety and learning algorithm of your system. Which means that the system cannot read/search or modify any program that the `main` program depends on (including itself)."
