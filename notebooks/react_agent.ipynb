    "# ReACT Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "For many, a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent is synonymous with the ReACT architecture. This simple yet powerful architecture is present in most mainstream Agentic frameworks. In this notebook, I aim to explain how ReACT works under the hood and demonstrate that HybridAGI, as a general-purpose, programmable graph-based Agentic framework, can indeed build a ReACT agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do not advocate for the ReACT architecture as the ultimate solution, especially for complex tasks, due to its lack of control and efficiency. Nevertheless, if you're new to Graph-based Prompt Programming, a ReACT agent can serve as an excellent starting point. With HybridAGI, you can iteratively enhance this initial agent and deviate from the ReACT architecture by adding more actions and decisions, all within the same framework. This flexibility is one of the key strengths of HybridAGI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its essence, a ReACT agent is composed by two elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A decision for choosing the tool to use\n",
    "- A loop to iteratively adapt to the user input"
