    "# Simulating User\n",
    "\n",
    "In HybridAGI, the User is simulated by default because being able to run a graph program without human input is required to optimize or finetune any interactive program. Many other frameworks to avoid this constraint just removed the possibility to interact with the user during the execution of a plan. But for us, with a background in Human-Human & Human-Robot collaboration, speaking is a goal-directed action that happen in a plan (or program in our case).\n",
    "\n",
    "In HybridAGI, we made 2 different tools to interact with the User:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Speak`: This tool send a message to the user, the message is being stored into the chat history and the last message is given as final answer to the system. \n",
    "- `AskUser`: This tool ask a question to the user, both question and answer are being stored into the chat history, when the tool is simulated (by default) the answer is simulated by LLM based on the user profile and chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following graph program, we are going to disambiguate the Objective of the program, to spice things up, we are going to make 2 programs and use sub-program calls."
