      "Human cognition is founded, in part, on four systems for representing objects, actions, number, and space. It may be based, as\n",
      "well, on a ﬁfth system for representing social partners. Each system has deep roots in human phylogeny and ontogeny, and it\n",
      "guides and shapes the mental lives of adults. Converging research on human infants, non-human primates, children and adults\n",
      "in diverse cultures can aid both understanding of these systems and attempts to overcome their limits.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Cognitive science has been dominated by two views of\n",
      "human nature. On one view, the human mind is a ﬂexible\n",
      "and adaptable mechanism for discovering regularities in\n",
      "experience: a single learning system that copes with all\n",
      "the diversity of life. On the competing view, the human\n",
      "mind is a collection of special-purpose mechanisms, each\n",
      "shaped by evolution to perform a particular function.\n",
      "The ﬁrst view traces back to Enlightenment thinkers\n",
      "such as Locke (1689) and Hume (1748) and has been\n",
      "invigorated more recently by cognitive psychologists and\n",
      "neural network theorists (e.g. Rumelhart & McClelland,\n",
      "1985; Hinton, 1993). The second view was inspired by\n",
      "Darwin (1871) and gained prominence with the rise of\n",
      "evolutionary psychology (e.g. Cosmides & Tooby, 1994;\n",
      "Pinker, 2002). Much public discussion has focused on\n",
      "the diverging ways in which these views explain human\n",
      "behavior. Does a given ethnic group excel in mathematics\n",
      "because its members have studied more diligently, or\n",
      "because they have inherited greater talent? Do some\n",
      "adolescents join violent gangs because they learned\n",
      "aggressive behavior from their communities, or because\n",
      "they inherited a predisposition toward intergroup com-\n",
      "petition? Behind these speciﬁc questions lies a more\n",
      "general concern: To what degree can we human beings\n",
      "determine our fates and choose our futures? With enough\n",
      "cognitive work, can any person develop her mathematical\n",
      "talents and control her aggression?\n",
      "Developmental science was born from these concerns,\n",
      "and its research bears on these questions. We believe its\n",
      "research has shown that both these views are false: humans\n",
      "are endowed neither with a single, general-purpose learning\n",
      "system nor with myriad special-purpose systems and\n",
      "predispositions. Instead, we believe that humans are\n",
      "endowed with a small number of separable systems of\n",
      "core knowledge. New, ﬂexible skills and belief systems\n",
      "build on these core foundations.\n",
      "Studies of human infants and non-human animals,\n",
      "focused on the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of\n",
      "knowledge, provide evidence for four core knowledge\n",
      "systems (Spelke, 2004). These systems serve to represent\n",
      "inanimate objects and their mechanical interactions,\n",
      "agents and their goal-directed actions, sets and their\n",
      "numerical relationships of ordering, addition and sub-\n",
      "traction, and places in the spatial layout and their geo-\n",
      "metric relationships. Each system centers on a set of\n",
      "principles that serves to individuate the entities in its\n",
      "domain and to support inferences about the entities’\n",
      "behavior. Each system, moreover, is characterized by a\n",
      "set of signature limits that allow investigators to identify\n",
      "the system across tasks, ages, species, and human cultures.\n",
      "The core system of object representation has been\n",
      "studied most extensively. It centers on the spatio-temporal\n",
      "principles of cohesion (objects move as connected and\n",
      "bounded wholes), continuity (objects move on connected,\n",
      "unobstructed paths), and contact (objects do not interact\n",
      "at a distance) (Aguiar & Baillargeon, 1999; Leslie & Keeble,\n",
      "1987; Spelke, 1990). These principles allow human infants\n",
      "as well as other animals to perceive object boundaries,\n",
      "to represent the complete shapes of objects that move\n",
      "partly or fully out of view, and to predict when objects\n",
      "will move and where they will come to rest. Some of\n",
      "these abilities are observed in the absence of any visual\n",
