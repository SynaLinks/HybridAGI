class FalkorDBMemory():
    """
    The base class for FalkorDB-based memory stores.

    This class provides core functionality for interacting with FalkorDB,
    including initialization of the database connection, graph selection,
    index creation, and basic operations like checking existence and clearing data.

    It serves as a foundation for more specialized memory classes that implement
    specific types of memory (e.g., fact memory, document memory) using FalkorDB
    as the underlying storage system.

    Attributes:
        hostname (str): The hostname of the FalkorDB server.
        port (int): The port number of the FalkorDB server.
        username (str): The username for authentication (if required).
        password (str): The password for authentication (if required).
        index_name (str): The name of the index used for storage.
        graph_index (str): The identifier for the specific graph within the index.
        indexed_label (str): The label used for indexing nodes in the graph.
        wipe_on_start (bool): Whether to clear the memory when initializing.
        client (FalkorDB): The FalkorDB client instance.
        _graph (Graph): The graph object representing the selected or created graph.
