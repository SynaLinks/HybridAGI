## What is HybridAGI?

HybridAGI is the first (self)programmable LLM-based Agent that enables you to define its behavior using a **graph-based prompt programming** approach. Unlike other frameworks that view agents as advanced chatbots, we have adopted a methodology that is rooted in computer science, cognitive sciences, and symbolic AI.

### Why HybridAGI?

We are not satisfied with the current trajectory of Agent-based systems that lack control and efficiency. Today's approach is to build React/MKRL agents that do what they want without any human control, resulting in infinite loops of nonsense because they tend to stay in their data distribution. Multi-agent systems try to solve that, but instead result in more nonsense and prohibitive costs due to the agents chitchatting with each other. Moreover, today's agents require fine-tuning to enhance/correct the behavior of the agent system. In contrast, with HybridAGI, the only thing you need to do is to modify the behavior graph.

We advocate that fine-tuning should be done only as a last resort when in-context learning fails to give you the expected result. Any person who has already fine-tuned a LM knows that gathering data is hard, but having the right variability in your dataset is even harder, thus prohibiting most companies from leveraging this technology if they don't have many AI scientists. By rooting cognitive sciences into computer science concepts, without obfuscating them, we empower programmers to build the Agent system of their dreams by controlling the sequence of action and decision.

Our goal is to build an agent system that solves real-world problems by using an intermediary language interpretable by both humans and machines. If we want to keep humans in the loop in the coming years, we need to design Agent systems for that purpose.

### Graphs for planning and knowledge management, no finetuning required.

**No React Agents here**, the only agent system that we provide is a **Graph Interpreter Agent** that follow a strict methodology by executing node by node the graph programs it have in memory.

We provide everything to build your LLM application with a focus around Cypher Graph databases. We provide also a local database for rapid prototyping before scaling your application with graph databases.

### Optimizable Agent & Data Extraction Pipelines

With HybridAGI you can build data extraction pipelines, RAG applications or advanced Agent systems, each being possibly optimized by using DSPy optimizers. We also provide pre-made modules and metrics for easy prototyping.

Each module and data type is *strictly typed* and use Pydantic as data validation layer. You can build pipelines in no time by stacking Modules sequentially or build the Agent system of your dream using Graph Programs.

### Dynamic Long-Term Memory System



### Native tools

We provide the following list of native tools to R/W into the memory system or modify the state of the agent:

### Install

```
pip install hybridagi
```

### Differences with LangGraph/LangChain or Llama-index

We focus on explainable and robust systems, we don't support ReACT Agents that lack control and efficiency. We also provide everything to scale your application into production by offering optimized pipelines and agents based on DSPy.

### Differences with DSPy

Unlike DSPy, our programs are not static but dynamic and can adapt to the user query. Moreover we focus our work on Graphs and neuro-symbolic AGI systems. Moreover, the graph programs are easier to build than implementing them from scratch.
